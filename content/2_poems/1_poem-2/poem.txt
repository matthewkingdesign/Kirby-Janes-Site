Text:

I pour out my heart of love,
Words tumbling, 
Emotion rising,
Passion surging forth.
I sing out!
It’s not enough, but how can I give you more?
You have all of me.  Yet you deserve more than this.

Then you say “My love, just a glimpse of your eye will undo my heart.”

It’s all you ask.
My response,
A return of your love.
You provoke within me,
A passion ignited, 
A commitment to follow after you.
My hearts response to your words
This is our love!

You are the author; you perfect our love.
My reply to your song with my own is our duet
A song echoed in eternity!
A bride and a groom.  
A father and child.
In friendship, the greatest love song.
A battle cry, a victorious shout!
This love.
