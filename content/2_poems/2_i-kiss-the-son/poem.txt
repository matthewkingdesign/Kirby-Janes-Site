I kiss the Son.
Dare I kiss the cheek of the Most High God?
Dare I kiss the cheek that carried the tears for my lost soul?
And my broken life, my wounded heart!

Dare I kiss the face of the man who is God?
Dare I kiss the one who took the hit for my pain?
My hateful rebellion and crippling shame!
Dare I kiss the face of the man who took mine?
Dare I kiss the man who made mine His own?
My empty heart, my conditional love!  
Dare I kiss the Son, who is the king?
Dare I kiss the King of heaven?
Who reached for me and whispers my name!

In the dark I hear His voice, In the light I feel His Glory!

So, I kiss the Son, the Most High God.
I kiss my King, my own one
Who ravished my heart by loving me,
When I hated all and said “not yet!”
I kiss the face of the one who cried my tears.
I kiss the man who cried out for my sin
Who took what was mine and gave me His.
While I was unaware, while I was in the dark.

He stands so close and I feel Him near.
I kiss the face of the man who is GOD!
I kiss the Son.
